This file was forked 12 August 2017 from CORaleigh. 

Following Civic Spark Day, we found this to be a start for a centralized location for all parks in the 
Wake County area (regardless of jurisdiction!) 

Plan to switch the data in the site from just City of Raleigh parks to all parks in Wake county, regardless of jurisdiction.

Will default to selecting desired amenities first and display list { Name of park, amenity icons } 
+ icon will display detailed view with child line of { address, distance from input address }
